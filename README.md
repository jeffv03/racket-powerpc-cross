racket-powerpc-cross
====================

Cross compiler script (or a basis for one) to build racket on PowerPC linux

Thought I'd share this... you may want to tweak `HOST` and `PATH`, but I guess that's it.

In case you missed it (at the head of the file...) credit to: http://www.wedesoft.de/racket-on-android.html

Rumour has it that e500 PowerPC processors (I'm using an e500v2, Freescale P1012),
exhibit some weird behaviour in the JIT. Anyone want to enlighten me?
